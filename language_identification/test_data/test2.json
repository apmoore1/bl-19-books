[[9, "PREFACE. Reader, this is a peaceful book. Unlike its far larger and more ambitious predecessor, it does not deal with war. Peace, national security, and com mercial prosperity are its watch-words ; and if these three can be perpetuated and extended in the \" superior country \" here under consideration, without war and without annexation, the greater will be the triumph of British statesmanship. Lord Eipon, wishing to carry out the spirit of Lord Canning's proclamation of 1858, last year declared that the continuation of Native States was an advantage to such states, and to Great Britain. Of course, there must be exceptions to such a wise, general rule. Great Britain, unfortunately, too often finds herself, while endeavouring to civilise mankind, in the position of the Psalmist, who was for peace while his enemies sought for war.

Nowhere seems she to find \" rest with men.\" The Burmese Question, in the humble opinion of the writer, should now occupy the large share of public atten tion which has been given throughout the past year or more to Afghanistan ; and when the Viceroy has so forcibly remarked that peace and rest are the real wants of India, in order that the country might \"devote itself to the improvement of its agriculture and commerce \" \u2014 our late military successes and upholding of British prestige in the former region affording suitable opportunity for such a remark \u2014 turning from Afghanistan to Burma at this time would seem to be a natural and prudent step. It is just one from financial ruin to financial prosperity, with Commerce beckoning to her enterprising supporters to come on. As a practical subject of the first importance, the Bur mese comes far nearer to us than many other questions ; for in its settlement a lasting good is sure to follow ; while as regards the solution of other weighty national problems, it must candidly be said, at present \u2014 \" The dawn is overcast, the morning lours, And heavily in clouds brings in the day.\" Is it not pleasing, then, to turn from such gloomy prospects, and give attention to where Hope, on"], [11, "PREFACE. VII practical grounds, pictures the dawn of a pros perous and tranquil day breaking out in all Burma ; a land in these fast times of education and so-called national enlightenment shamefully unknown to the intelligent classes of Great Britain. However tribes may be warring against tribes in the East at the present time \u2014 however wily European diplo matists may be looking out for the decline of Albion's influence in Asia \u2014 let us be placed on sound and profitable as well as peaceful relations with the people of our next-door neighbour, Upper Burma. With the lower portion of the country under our control, paying for years past a surplus revenue of some millions sterling to the Indian Imperial Treasury, surely the upper portion demands far more attention than it has yet received ; for, as hereafter will be urged, the real interests of the two are inseparable. But, look on the two pictures \u2014 on British and Independent Burma ; what a difference in local progress, happiness, and pros perity ! And what a tremendous difference between the results of the last Afghan and the Second Burmese Wars. There is something terribly mono tonous about many of the political questions of the day. \" Fresh woods and pastures new \" are urgently required by politicians as well as by the public.
